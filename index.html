                    Hello and welcome to Conor's fun games of fun! I invite you all to relax, unwind and enjoy the super
                    super fun games I have created for your entertainment. All you newbies, I
                    ask you to sign up and create a FREE account in order to track your scores and compete
                    on the leaderboards. Alternateively you can play as a guest, however your
                    scores will NOT be recorded. So if wish to just throw away your time playing
                    meaningless games with no evidence for your accomplishments, go ahead, play
                    as a guest. If you want to avail of all the benefits of this leaderboard
                    system I spent SO MUCH time and work making for you I emplore you to create an account.
